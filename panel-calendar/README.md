### Panel calendar

This example displays a window with a button to select a date. 
Once clicked will display a dialog with a panel-calendar widget to select a date and once
a date is picked, will close the clanedar diallog and replace the "pick a dataae" text with 
the selected date in dd-mm-yyyy format.
